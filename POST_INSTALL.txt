It's strongly recommended to install bash_completion. In this way you will have
the best user experience.
Linux users can install it using their package manager (apt, zypper, yum, emerge...),
while OSX users can install it via ports, fink or brew.

Now that jump is installed execute the following command:
  sudo cp `gem contents jump | grep completion` /path_to/bash_completion.d

The 'bash_completion.d' directory is usually located under /etc/.
OSX users will find this directory under fink/port/brew installation directory (e.g. '/opt/local/etc').


If you do not want to install 'bash_completion' then execute the following command:
  cp `gem contents jump | grep shell_driver` ~/.jump_shell_driver

and add the following code to your bash configuration file (e.g. '~/.bash_profile' or '~/.bashrc'):

  source ~/.jump_shell_driver

Beware: without bash_completion you won't be able use jump's advanced completion features.
