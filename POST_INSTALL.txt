In order to be able to change directories, Jump needs a shell driver you will
have to add to your bash configuration file (e.g. '~/.bash_profile' or '~/.bashrc'):

    function jump {
      if [ ${1:0:1} == "-" ]; then
        jump-bin $*
      else
        cd $(jump-bin $*)
      fi
    }

If you prefer a shorter command to type even less, just rename the function
with a shorter name (e.g. 'function j {...}').
