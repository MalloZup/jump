It's strongly recommended to install bash_completion. In this way you will have
the best user experience.
Linux users can install it using their package manager (apt, zypper, yum, emerge...),
while OSX users can install it via ports, fink or brew.

Now that jump is installed you have to create a file called 'jump' containing the
following text:

    _jump()
    {
      local cur prev opts
      COMPREPLY=()
      cur="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}"
      prev="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD-1]}"
      opts="--help -h --add -a --del -d --list -l"

      if [[ ${prev} == -d || ${prev} == --d* ]] ; then
        # complete the del command with a list of the available bookmarks
        local bookmarks=$(jump --bc)
        COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W "${bookmarks}" -- ${cur}) )
        return 0
      fi

      if [[ ${cur:0:1} == "-" ]]; then
        COMPREPLY="$(compgen -W "${opts}" -- ${cur}) "
        return 0
      else
        local bookmarks=$(jump --bc ${cur})
        COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W "${bookmarks}" -- ${cur}) )
        return 0
      fi
    }

    function jump {
      #echo "jump called with $*"
      if [ ${1:0:1} == "-" ]; then
        jump-bin $*
      else
        cd $(jump-bin $*)
      fi
    }

    complete -o nospace -F _jump jump


The file must be located inside of the 'bash_completion.d' directory, which is
usually located under /etc/.

If you do not want to install 'bash_completion' then add the following code
to your bash configuration file (e.g. '~/.bash_profile' or '~/.bashrc'):

    function jump {
      if [ ${1:0:1} == "-" ]; then
        jump-bin $*
      else
        cd $(jump-bin $*)
      fi
    }

Beware: without bash_completion you won't be able use jump's advanced completion features.
